# Deep Learning Task 2 - Backpropagation, Gradient Descent and Training

Continuation to [DL_T1](https://github.com/davidrojas0791/DL_T1), we are tasked to program backpropagation for the model built previously.

Apart from the calculations necessary to implement backpropagation some concepts explored are:
- Cross Entropy
- Categorical Cross Entropy
- Celu
- Swish
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
