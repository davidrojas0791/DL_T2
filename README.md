# Deep Learning Task 2 - Backpropagation, Gradient Descent and Training

Continuation to [DL_T1](https://github.com/davidrojas0791/DL_T1), we are tasked to program backpropagation for the model built previously. Apart from the calculations necessary to implement backpropagation some concepts such as `Cross Entropy`, `Categorical Cross Entropy`, `Celu`, `Swish`, `Stochastic Gradient Descent` are introduced and explained throughout this project.
